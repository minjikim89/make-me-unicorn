# Strategy

## Mission

- Problem we solve: solo founders lose momentum from fragmented todo tools and inconsistent execution.
- Why now: AI-native builders need execution memory across planning, coding, and launch work.

## ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)

- Primary customer: solo technical founder shipping a paid product in 90 days.
- Excluded customer: enterprise PM teams.
- Buyer persona: founder-builder managing product and engineering alone.

## Value Proposition

- One-line value proposition: ship weekly with fewer blind spots and clearer decisions.
- Better than alternatives: combines planning discipline and release guardrails, not just notes.

## Positioning

- Category: founder execution operating system.
- Main competitors: generic PM tools, Notion templates.
- Why we can win: phase gates + CLI checks + decision memory workflow.

## Success Metrics

- North Star metric: weekly shipped milestones.
- Supporting metric 1: activation to paid conversion.
- Supporting metric 2: release rollback rate.

## Strategic Risks

- Risk: users see this as template overhead.
- Mitigation: improve automation (`start --emit bundle`, CI guardrails, simple onboarding).
