# UX

## UX Principles

- Clarity over customization
- One next action per screen
- Fast read, low cognitive overhead

## Information Architecture

- Main screens: Dashboard, Milestones, Gates, Decisions, Billing
- Key flows: create milestone -> complete checklist -> publish update

## Content and Messaging

- Voice and tone: direct, practical, no fluff
- CTA writing rules: action-first, expected outcome in one line

## Accessibility

- Contrast and readability: WCAG AA baseline
- Keyboard navigation: core flows fully keyboard-usable
- Alternative text: decorative images excluded, informative images captioned

## UX Quality Bar

- Empty/error states: explicit guidance for next step
- Loading experience: optimistic updates where safe
- Mobile behavior: fully usable for triage and checklist updates
