# Product Evolution Path

This path combines product maturity and framework maturity.

## Stage A: Foundation (MVP)

- Framework: docs + prompts baseline

## Stage B: Revenue Engine (Phase 1)

- Required: `M2` gate
- Framework: `billing` and `auth` mode discipline, first ADR cadence

## Stage C: Trust and Operations (Phase 2)

- Focus: legal/security/reliability baseline
- Required: `M3` gate
- Framework: `compliance` and `reliability` operation loops

## Stage D: Growth and Distribution (Phase 3)

- Focus: acquisition and activation throughput
- Required: `M4` gate
- Framework: `growth` mode, SEO/OG/analytics checks in every release

## Stage E: Scale Readiness (Phase 4)

- Focus: stable operation under real load
- Required: `M5` gate
- Framework: alerting, backup/recovery drills, incident playbook

## Stage F: Systemization (Phase 5+)

- Focus: reduce founder cognitive load
- Framework roadmap:
