# Known Issues

Track recurring problems and unresolved blockers across sessions.

## Failure Categories

### Context Deficit
The agent or founder lacked information needed to make the right call.
Example: LLM missed a constraint because `architecture.md` was not injected in the current mode.

### Direction Error
The approach selected was wrong or requirements were misunderstood.
Example: Chose client-side auth when server-side was required by the pricing model.

### Structural Conflict
Code and documentation contradict each other, causing loops or regressions.
Example: `pricing.md` says "free forever" but billing code enforces trial limits.
